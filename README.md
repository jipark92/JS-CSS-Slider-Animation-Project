# JS-CSS-Slider-Animation-Project

For this project, I will be making a simple one webpage that will showcase sliding picture animation using Javascript and CSS. This is to work on my javascript skill and especially css animation skill! I want to get good at using CSS as well although javascript is my main priority. Balancing out what I learn will eventaully help me understand both sides of developing front-end web development.
